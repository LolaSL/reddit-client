### Features

This reddit client offers a modern layout that is accessible from mobile and desktop devices with modern browsers. The application is implemented as a single page app (SPA), being based on React.

The user can choose from 25 predefined subreddits of varying categories. For each subreddit, the latest 26 posts are displayed. The displayed post content contains meta data like a title, the author, the publishing data, comments and upvotes aswell as the actual content in either textual form (displayed with a markdown renderer) or a picture, video or link.

It is possible to filter the posts of a subreddit with the given search box. By clicking on the title of a post, the post can be displayed in a focused modal view. Clicking the up - or downvote button simulates submitting a vote for the respective post (Since the Reddit API is read-only, no votes are actually submitted). Clicking the comments icon opens a selection of user comments for the respective post.

Dashboard includes an option to open a few links related to project and to login and logout from an application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
